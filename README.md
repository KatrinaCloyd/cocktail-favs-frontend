# Cocktail Favorites 

Covid got us all needing a drink! And getting bored with our standard go-tos. So let's find you some new cocktail recipes to give a try! 

### Details 

This page is built in javascript, using React and React Router. This page allows users to sign in to save favorites, see previously saved favorites, search for new cocktails by ingredient or name and see full cocktail recipes. 

### Resources

This page uses the CocktailDB API for all images and recipes: [https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

Also relies on my own back end DB for saving all user account information and saved favorites.  
Back End Repo: [https://github.com/KatrinaCloyd/favorite-cocktails-backend](https://github.com/KatrinaCloyd/favorite-cocktails-backend)

Built using the Create Ract App bootstrap. 

### Deployment

This page is still under construction so the deployed site is currently being served off the dev branch. All currently functional code can be found there. 


### To Do

- Add full recipe button to search result grid  
- Add measuerments to recipe card
